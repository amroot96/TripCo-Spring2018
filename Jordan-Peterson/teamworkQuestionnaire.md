1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ENTJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Electronic mail and slack are the best ways to reach me, monday wednesday and friday anytime before 10:30pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope that we implement all the functionality we can, and avoid conflict as much as possible.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Checking comminications more regularly and working off of others ideas and suggestions.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Everyone has a busy schedule and may not be able to review pull requests immediately.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I don't see a point in "trying to get a B", we can all try our hardest and try to get the highest grade we can.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I see this class as practice for the workforce, I don't think employers will be happy with that mentality.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm assuming about 5-6 hours a week per person, but that will depend on workload.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should deligate tasks to the people that are most comfortable with the skills required.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * That's unfortunate, there may be a genuine excuse, but I think there should be concequences for bailing on a commitment.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I would encourage all of us to try and make the best work we can, becuase this can be usefull as a portfolio piece when looking for a job.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * If their work habit doesn't impact my productivity, then I won't worry about it.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, I think reliable weekly meetings will be essential to keeping everyone on track and informed about the state of the project.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week may be good, but if needed I'm fine with twice a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * The more the better, but if only one or two people have the time to approve then that's okay. But this puts more responsibility on the 
approver.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Majority rule, but there can be an opportunity for compromise.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Step up my effort so that team member isn't forced to dominate the team process
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will ask members to put in more effort so this situation can stop happening.
