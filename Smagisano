# Teamwork Questionnaire for Scott Magisano

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * INTJ
2. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text or email. Any day but friday/saturday night I'll respond very quickly. On those days I'll respond the next morning. 
3. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Quite a lot. I expect us to work hard and gain some real experience in developement.
4. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Trying to do work during daytime hours. I normally work late at night.
5. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * figuring out how to work well with the two team members I don't know. But I think things will go well.
6. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think we all want A's. But I'll just work harder to get the grade I want if necessary.
7. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yes but with the knowledge that the group doesn't get the same grade. I think this is fair.
8. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 8 hours
9. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We'll discuss it as a group then make a decision. Hopefully it will make sense once we see the project.
10. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I'll stop trusting them and start doing the work myself or with the help of the rest of the team. I don't have a lot of patience for that. If they communicate though and let us know they are stuggling there will be no issues though I'm here to help as much as I can.
11. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We'll have an honest discussion then work something out.
12. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I'd like our group to try to finish things ahead of deadlines. Hopefully habits can stay private and we'll all just get our work done. 
13. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Probably not. Lets wait to see if it's necessary.
14. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Hopefully not at all.
15. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the decision. Probably not for small decisions, but we'll make big design decisions as a team for sure. 
16. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I doubt this will happen. We can work things out I'm sure. 
17. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I'll help them and ask if they need assistance. If they insist on doing a lot I'll make it very clear that I'm ready to help whenever they need it. 
18. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I probably won't complain. It's usually easier to do the work and move on.
