# Sprint 3 - 07 - Jackalope

## Goal
* To allow the user to save their trip. Clean our code and reduce code coverage to less than 50%. 
* Allow the user to select locations from a list and find an optimal trip. 
* Allow the user to display what they want when planning a trip.

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: Angela Root

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Coverage at least 50% overall for the class.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.
