# Sprint 2 - 7 - Jackalope

## Goal

Work together on each issue in zenhub until we're all satasfied with our product. We're planning on working on and completing 7 epics each with many tasks. We'll work together and always have a working version.

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.
